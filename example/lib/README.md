# Examples

This directory contains examples for how to use the code generation
features of the `copyable` package to avoid writing unnecessary code.

#### Setup
In your `pubspec.yaml`, make sure you have `copyable` as a dependency

As mentioned in the `copyable` docs, there are 4 different ways to
implement copy-like behavior using the `copyable` package
(Copyable/Copier, Local/Foreign). Depending on your use case(s), you


| | Copyable | Copier
 --- | --- | --- 
 **Local** | `copyable` | `copier`
 **Foreign** | `foreignCopyableLib` | `foreignCopierLib`
